            This session will discuss the basics of Robot Motion Planning, followed by 
            planning in continuous and hybrid (continuous-discrete) domain. Next, we will introduce uncertainty in robotics and three related sequential decision making 
            under uncertainty frameworks: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), and 
            Reinforcement Learning (RL).
