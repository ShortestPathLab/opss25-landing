        This session bridges theoretical concepts and practical implementations in MAPF. We will explore various MAPF variants, including suboptimal MAPF and lifelong MAPF, while addressing real-time constraints and practical considerations.
        
        Discussion points:
        - Bridging theoretical concepts and practical implementations
        - MAPF variants: suboptimal MAPF, lifelong MAPF
        - Real-time constraints and practical considerations
        - Suboptimal approaches: Large Neighborhood Search, PIBT, policy-driven planning, and learning
