Optimisation and planning summer school (OPSS) expects all participants (meaning persons and entities that attend or are involved with the conference) to comply at all times with relevant local laws and with certain standards of behavioural conduct toward one another. In particular, OPSS will not tolerate abuse or discriminatory or sexual harassment toward any person during any conference-related activities, including but not limited to submission, reviewing, tutorials, workshops, or social events.

## Abuse

Abuse is any action directed at an individual that (a) interferes substantially with that person’s participation or (b) causes that person to fear for their personal safety. This includes (but is not limited to) threats, intimidation, bullying, stalking or following, psychological attacks, physical violence, threats of physical violence, threats of professional or financial harm, humiliating or derogatory speech or any behaviour that places (or gives rise to a reasonable expectation of placing) the health or safety of any person at risk, whether during conference activities or one-on-one. Sustained disruption of presentations or scheduled events or harassing photography or recording may be considered forms of abuse.

## Discriminatory harassment

Discriminatory harassment is any conduct that discriminates or denigrates an individual on the basis of personal or identifying characteristics as well as any other characteristic protected by law in the location where conference activity takes place. This includes (but is not limited to) age, race, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, gender, gender identity or presentation, sexual orientation, physical appearance, religious affiliation, creed, marital or familial status, disability. Generally offensive, prejudicial, or harmful verbal/written comments or displayed visual images may be considered discriminatory harassment.

## Sexual harassment

Sexual harassment is inappropriate verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. This includes (but is not limited to) unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, inappropriate touching of an individual’s body, degrading or humiliating comments about an individual’s appearance. Inappropriate or gratuitous use of nudity, sexual images, or offensively caricatured images may be considered sexual harassment.
OPSS agents and representatives are empowered to take all necessary action to prevent or stop any conduct that appears in their judgement to be violating this code. Participants that are asked to stop their unacceptable behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Non-compliance with these requests may result in temporary removal from the conference. Serious or repeat violations may lead to an individual being permanently barred from the conference series, notification of the violator’s employer and, where appropriate, referral to local law enforcement. No refunds or other compensation will be provided to those who are removed from the conference. Any sanctions beyond temporary removal must be approved by the OPSS Council.

OPSS expects all participants to formally endorse this code of conduct and to actively prevent and discourage unacceptable behaviour. Participants are further encouraged to raise awareness and understanding of the code at the conference. Encouraging or advocating conduct that is disallowed by the code is unacceptable.

To report any behaviour that violates this code, or to give feedback on its contents, please contact the OPSS representative for diversity and inclusion.
