  Our 5-day program is designed as an intensive learning retreat. Each day
  begins with lectures and tutorials on key topics in artificial intelligence.
  In the afternoons, we'll have hands-on exercises and problem-solving sessions.
  For the evenings, we've prepared social gatherings, hackathons and challenges
  to solve before the next day.
